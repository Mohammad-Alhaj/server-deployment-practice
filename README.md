## Notes from instructor
* There are two error handdler form server and user (404,500)
* even loop staking the prossess 
* in package.json we should put in side "scripts"

```
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",             // I put this line manule because the instructor do that
    "start": "node index.js"     // I  put this line manula because heroku it's give me error 
  },
  ```
  ## My notes
  * to Initialize app ```npm init -y ```

  * to install the dependencies ```npm install dotenv express jest```

  * Whene I test my server after the finish I should install the test package 
  ```jest``` I downloaded and I should install the ```spurtest```
